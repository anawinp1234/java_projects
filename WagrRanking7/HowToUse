1. How do you want to use it:
    objIO.biggestMovesTopPlyrs(tm, tr);
    objIO.biggestMovesTopPlyrs(tm, tr );

2. slice the arrListofLines to get the first tr --> give it a tr_ArrayList

3. loop through tr_ArrayList:
4. inside loop, split to get F[1], make it int, and abs, make sure you don;t lose track of the idex in each loop
5. inside loop, 
        1. keep track off index of tr_arrayLuist while looping through tr_Array find
